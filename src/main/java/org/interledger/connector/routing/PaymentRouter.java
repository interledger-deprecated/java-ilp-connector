  /**
   * Given a source {@link Transfer} with an embedded Interledger Payment (i.e., a transfer made to this connector on an
   * underlying ledger, also known as an "incoming transfer), determine the "next hop" for an ILP payment according to
   * the routing and quoting requirements of a particular connector implementation.
   *
   * At a general level, this method works as follows:
   *
   * Given an ILP Payment from Aâ†’C, find the next hop B on the payment path from A to C. If the next hop is the final
   * one (B == C), return a hop with {@link InterledgerHop#isFinal()} set to {@code true} and information that will
   * direct a connector event-handler to deliver construct a transfer on the final ledger (B/C in this case). Otherwise,
   * return a transfer at B, with an embedded {@link InterledgerPayment} destined for ledger C.
   *
   * @param sourceLedgerPrefix      The {@link InterledgerAddress} prefix of the source ledger that an incoming transfer
   *                                (for this Connector) was received on.
   * @param interlederPaymentPacket An {@link InterledgerPayment} containing information about the overall ILP payment.
   * @param sourceTransferAmount    The amount of the incoming source transfer.
   * 
   * @return {@link Optional} of type {@link InterledgerHop}
